# M U L T I P R I O R I T Y Q U E U E

In this assignment you are expected to develop an extensible system that can sort items according to
different type of priorities. An item in the queue can have one or multiple priorities, final priority
score of the item can be calculated as a sum of each priority type depending on their own rules. Items
can be added, edited or removed; queue must be always sorted after changes.

## DESI GN P RI N C I PLE S/M OT I V A T I O N

Queue and ordering can be easily achieved in current high-level languages. This assignment proposes
a problem with an extensible priority management requirement. Therefore your code should be
ready for integrating a new Priority Type. Even though the execution of the submission is important,
more focus will be on the design of such a simple system. Before submitting your source code, define
another priority type to your liking and analyze how many classes are affected and should be
changed. If the changes are high, reconsider your design. Even though queue and priority can be
easily associated with performance and implementation of such system, this assignment is not
focused on a queue implementation from scratch. Linq and standard Collection libraries are free to
use.

## C O M M A N D T Y PES

All input lines start with a single capital letter as a command parameter and followed by an integer id
for following the item. Add and Edit commands continue with several priority properties, which will
be described on next section.
A 1 [priority types] Add new item with Id 1
E 2 [priority types] Edit item id = 2 with new priority types
R 7 Remove item with id = 7

```
PRIORITY TYP ES

```
TIME PRIORITY
```
An item with a time priority can be supplied with T argument followed by an integer. Following
integer is the number of minutes. Items with time priority smaller than 5 minutes have priority score
of 10, between 5 and 30 minutes priority score is 3, otherwise 1.
Examples;
A 1 T 4 Time priority with four minutes Score 10
A 2 T 26 Time priority with 26 minutes Score 3
A 3 T 48 Time priority with 48 minutes Score 1


```
ALPHA PRIORITY
```
Alpha priority can be defined with an A and a char value only consisting of capital English alphabet
letters. In alphabetical priority, A has the lowest priority of 1 and Z has the highest priority of 26. All
the letters in between have priorities equal to their order in the English alphabet.
Examples;
A 1 A A Alpha priority with A Score 1
A 2 A Z Alpha priority with Z Score 26
A 3 A J Alpha priority with J Score 10

```
COLOR PRIORITY
```
Color priority can be defined with a C and a string value representing the color. Three valid color
values exist; Red = 20, Green = 4, Blue = 18.
Examples;
A 1 C Blue Color priority with Blue Score 18
A 2 C Green Color priority with Green Score 4
A 3 C Red Color priority with Red Score 20

```
MULTI PRIORITY
```
Any item can have multiple priority properties. Priority properties donâ€™t have any order. Following
examples are all valid.
A 1 C Blue T 4 Item with both Blue (Color) and
4 (Time) priority

```
Score = 18 (C) + 10 (T) = 28
```
```
A 2 A T C Green Item with both T (Alpha) and
Green (Color) priority
```
```
Score = 20 (A) + 4 (C) = 24
```
```
A 3 A J T 27 C Red Item with J (Alpha), 27 (Time)
and Red (Color) priority
```
```
Score = 10 (A) + 3 (T) + 20 (C)
= 33
```

Each command read from the input file should be written to output file on execution. And after each
command the current queue should be written to output. When printing the queue each element in
the queue should be written on their own line with their Id and current score. i.e. 1 10 line on output
means, item with Id 1 has a current score of 10. You can find two sample input files and outputs in
the following tables for reference.

Input files will be free of errors, do not error check in your source code. Your user is sane. All
commands will be inside an input file and the outputs are expected to be written on an output file.
Filenames will be provided as a command line argument. Input files are plain txt files. Application will
be called from command line as followed;
./queue.exe input-1.txt output-1.txt

```
SUBMISSION
```
You should submit your C# source code with a Visual Studio solution file. Do not submit any
executable files, clear your project before submission. Send all project files to
careers.commodity@matriksdata.com in a compressed .rar file. If you have any problem on
submission, please contact with an email. With your submission, provide at least a paragraph of
description on your source code and your design decisions.
